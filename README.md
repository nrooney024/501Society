## How It Works

Constructed a NodeJS back-end that connects to a MongoDB database, with a Mongoose schema. The front-end is built using EJS and authentication uses Passport.

## Setup and Running Locally

To run the Real Estate Assistant backend locally, you'll need:

- Java JDK 11 or newer
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your computer
- Environment variables for API keys (e.g., OpenCage API key)

The backend is built with Maven, making it easy to compile and run with just a few commands.

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB running locally or a MongoDB Atlas account for the database
