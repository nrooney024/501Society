# Welcome to the Github repo for 501 Society! 

*Below is a little bit about this project, but please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions:*

## What is 5:01 Society?
501 Society helps provide structure to online learning, by providing the tools to make and discover online curriculums.

## Why is it called 5:01 Society?
Generally, people have their 9 to 5 jobs, but 5:01 is your time. It's your time to learning something new like how to become a software engineer, or a new hobby like what techniques do you need to rock climb. Whatever it is, 5:01 Society is here to help!

## What is next for the development of 5:01 Society?
We still have a long road ahead, but for now we're finalizing the MVP by testing functionality and transferring from EJS to React, to make a more flexible and faster website.
